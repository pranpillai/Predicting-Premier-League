# Predicting-Premier-League

Here is a project I carried out on prediciting the final standings in the English Premier League (Football) for the 2021-22 season. The aim of the project was to develop a model that could successfully predict the outcome of every remaining match of the 2021-22 season. At the time of starting this project, we were just over halfway through the season so there were still many fixtures left to be predicted.
By using a variety of modelling techniques and aiming to enhance my model by adding features such as a teams current "form", the home advantage and head-to- head statistics between teams, my ultimate aim was to succesfully predict the outcome of the premier league.
The project is broken down into three sections:
1. Cleaning & EDA of the data
2. Modelling the data
3. A presentation of my final outcome titled- Premier League Predictions

Enjoy!
